  # Just a DEMO
  # Expectation: set schema at end of change log. It is used when rollback is executed.
  # It is not really useful as we rely on user's search_path to find crm_data
  # And it worth of noting that it doesn't really work well if we have to rollback multiple times.
  # i.e. deploy 3 scripts. rollback 1 and find we need to rollback another 1. As this set-search_path had been rolled back/executed along with the first rollback
